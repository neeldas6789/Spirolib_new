The `spiro_features_extraction` class provides a modular architecture for extracting advanced mathematical features from forced expiratory (FE) spirometry signals. It includes:

* Area under the Flow-Volume Loop (% predicted)
* Angle of Collapse (AC)
* Deflating Balloon Model

All modules assume the FE signal is standardized and oriented such that:

* Volume is in litres (TLC at 0, RV positive)
* Flow is in litres/s and positive
* Signal is right-skewed (i.e., normal expiratory flow direction)

## Class: `spiro_features_extraction`

Main container class encapsulating multiple feature extraction models.

---

### Subclass: `areaFE`

Calculates the area under the expiratory flow-volume loop and its predicted value using ECCS93 equations.

#### Initialization

```python
area = spiro_features_extraction.areaFE(FE_volume, FE_flow, sex, age, height)
```

#### Methods

* `calc_AreaPred()`

  * Returns predicted AreaFE using demographic inputs.

* `calc_areaFE()`

  * Computes area under the FE curve using trapezoidal integration.

---

### Subclass: `angle_of_collapse`

Implements a data-driven geometric fitting model to compute the angle of collapse after PEF.

#### Initialization

```python
ac = spiro_features_extraction.angle_of_collapse(FE_volume, FE_flow)
```

#### Methods

* `generate_linemodel(x, y, index)`

  * Constructs a piecewise linear model intersecting point `(x, y)`

* `min_line_model_error(plotProcess=False)`

  * Loops through all post-PEF points to find best-fitting point minimizing squared error. Set `plotProcess=True` to visualize the fitting process.

* `get_angle(x_p, y_p)`

  * Computes the geometric angle between two segments joined at `(x_p, y_p)`

* `calc_AC(plotModel=False, plotProcess=False)`

  * Returns computed angle of collapse and squared error. Set `plotModel=True` to plot the fitted model, and `plotProcess=True` to visualize the fitting process.

---

### Subclass: `deflating_baloon`

Models the FE signal using second-order ODE dynamics. Simulates the lungs as a deflating balloon.

#### Initialization

```python
db = spiro_features_extraction.deflating_baloon(FE_time, FE_volume, FE_flow)
```

#### Core Methods

* `orient_and_snip_signal()`

  * Prepares volume/flow signals for modeling by standardizing orientation

* `reorient_model()`

  * Reverts simulated signal to original coordinate system

* `get_excitation_phase(T1, params)`

  * Internally handles the early phase of expiration (excitation) based on default initial conditions.

* `calc_hypothesis(params)`

  * Simulates the flow-volume signal using the selected model and parameters

* `Cost_Function(params)`

  * Computes error between predicted and actual volume/flow to be minimized

* `run_model(excitation_type="", plot_model=False, add_title_text="", **kwargs)`

  * Fits the model using `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution` and plots results.
  * `excitation_type`: now internally tracked; only the 'Default' behavior (initial conditions from PEF) is modeled.
  * `plot_model`: set to True to display the fitted model.
  * `add_title_text`: optional string appended to the plot title for annotation.

* `run_simulation(sim_param, sim_type="", num_sims, percentage_step, plot_FVL_only)`

  * Runs sensitivity analysis by varying one model parameter.   
  * `sim_type`: optional classification tag; simulation logic remains based on the default model.
  * Only the default excitation behavior is actively modeled.

* `calc_FEV1_FVC()`

  * Computes interpolated FEV1 and final FVC from model output

* `plot_model(only_FVL, add_title_text)`

  * Plots comparison between actual and simulated flow/volume signals

---

## Excitation Types

Previous `excitation_type` options (`Linear`, `Exponential pressure`, `Non linear`) are no longer actively modeled. The `run_model` method now defaults to initial conditions at PEF; `excitation_type` can still be passed but is used for internal classification only.

---

## Optimization Notes

All modeling is done via `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution`. Fit metrics include:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* RÂ² Score (flow and volume)

---

## Example Usage

```python
# Compute angle of collapse
ac = spiro_features_extraction.angle_of_collapse(volume, flow)
angle, cost = ac.calc_AC(plotModel=True)

# Compute AreaFE % predicted
af = spiro_features_extraction.areaFE(volume, flow, sex=1, age=35, height=170)
area_pred = af.calc_AreaPred()
area_actual = af.calc_areaFE()

# Fit balloon model
db = spiro_features_extraction.deflating_baloon(time, volume, flow)
# Model fitting with title annotation
db.run_model(excitation_type="", plot_model=True, add_title_text="Patient123")
# Sensitivity analysis on 'zeta' parameter
db.run_simulation(sim_param='zeta', sim_type="", num_sims=4, percentage_step=10, plot_FVL_only=True)
```
