# Documentation: `spiro_features_extraction`

The `spiro_features_extraction` class provides a modular architecture for extracting advanced mathematical features from forced expiratory (FE) spirometry signals. It includes:

* Area under the Flow-Volume Loop (% predicted)
* Angle of Collapse (AC)
* Deflating Balloon Model

All modules assume the FE signal is standardized and oriented such that:

* Volume is in litres (TLC at 0, RV positive)
* Flow is in litres/s and positive
* Signal is right-skewed (i.e., normal expiratory flow direction)

## Class: `spiro_features_extraction`

Main container class encapsulating multiple feature extraction models.

---

### Subclass: `areaFE`

Calculates the area under the expiratory flow-volume loop and its predicted value using ECCS93 equations.

#### Initialization

```python
area = spiro_features_extraction.areaFE(FE_volume, FE_flow, sex, age, height, race)
```

##### Parameters

1. `FE_volume`: array of forced expiratory volumes
2. `FE_flow`: array of forced expiratory flows
3. `sex`: 1 for male, 0 for female
4. `age`: age in years
5. `height`: height in cm
6. `race`: race/ethnicity code for reference equations

#### Methods

* `calc_AreaPred()`  
  Returns predicted AreaFE using demographic inputs.

* `calc_areaFE()`  
  Computes area under the FE curve using trapezoidal integration.

---

### Subclass: `angle_of_collapse`

Implements a data-driven geometric fitting model to compute the angle of collapse after PEF.

#### Initialization

```python
ac = spiro_features_extraction.angle_of_collapse(FE_volume, FE_flow)
```

#### Methods

* `generate_linemodel(x, y, index)`  
  Constructs a piecewise linear model intersecting point `(x, y)`

* `min_line_model_error(plotProcess=False)`  
  Loops through all post-PEF points to find best-fitting point minimizing squared error. Set `plotProcess=True` to visualize the fitting process.

* `get_angle(x_p, y_p)`  
  Computes the geometric angle between two segments joined at `(x_p, y_p)`

* `calc_AC(plotModel=False, plotProcess=False)`  
  Returns computed angle of collapse and squared error. Set `plotModel=True` to plot the fitted model, and `plotProcess=True` to visualize the fitting process.

---

### Subclass: `deflating_baloon`

Models the FE signal using second-order ODE dynamics. Simulates the lungs as a deflating balloon.

#### Initialization

```python
db = spiro_features_extraction.deflating_baloon(FE_time, FE_volume, FE_flow)
```

#### Core Methods

* `orient_and_snip_signal()`  
  Prepares volume/flow signals for modeling by standardizing orientation

* `reorient_model()`  
  Reverts simulated signal to original coordinate system

* `get_excitation_phase(T1, params)`  
  Internally handles the early phase of expiration (excitation) based on default initial conditions.

* `calc_hypothesis(params)`  
  Simulates the flow-volume signal using the selected model and parameters

* `Cost_Function(params)`  
  Computes error between predicted and actual volume/flow to be minimized

* `run_model(excitation_type="", plot_model=False, ...)`  
  Fits model using `differential_evolution` optimizer and plots results. Note: the default mechanism uses initial conditions at PEF for the deflation phase; other excitation types remain available but perform the same core deflation modeling.

* `run_simulation(sim_param, num_sims, percentage_step, plot_FVL_only)`  
  Runs sensitivity analysis by varying one model parameter based on the fitted default model.

* `calc_FEV1_FVC()`  
  Computes interpolated FEV1 and final FVC from model output

* `plot_model(only_FVL, add_title_text)`  
  Plots comparison between actual and simulated flow/volume signals

---

## Excitation Types

The `excitation_type` parameter in `run_model` can still be passed (`"Linear"`, `"Exponential pressure"`, `"Non linear"`, or default `""`), but all modes now funnel into the same deflation-phase ODE solver, using PEF-based initial conditions.

---

## Optimization Notes

All modeling is done via `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution`. Fit metrics include:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* RÂ² Score (flow and volume)

---

## Example Usage

```python
# Compute angle of collapse
ac = spiro_features_extraction.angle_of_collapse(volume, flow)
angle, cost = ac.calc_AC(plotModel=True)

# Compute AreaFE % predicted
af = spiro_features_extraction.areaFE(volume, flow, sex=1, age=35, height=170, race='Caucasian')
area_pred = af.calc_AreaPred()
area_actual = af.calc_areaFE()

# Fit balloon model
db = spiro_features_extraction.deflating_baloon(time, volume, flow)
db.run_model(excitation_type="", plot_model=True)  # uses PEF initial conditions
```

---

## Dependencies

* `numpy`
* `matplotlib.pyplot`
* `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution`
* `sklearn.metrics`
* `utilities` (custom plotting utility used inside `angle_of_collapse`)
