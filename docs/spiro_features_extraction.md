# Documentation: `spiro_features_extraction`

The `spiro_features_extraction` class provides a modular architecture for extracting advanced mathematical features from forced expiratory (FE) spirometry signals. It includes:

* Area under the Flow-Volume Loop (% predicted)
* Angle of Collapse (AC)
* Deflating Balloon Model

All modules assume the FE signal is standardized and oriented such that:

* Volume is in litres (TLC at 0, RV positive)
* Flow is in litres/s and positive
* Signal is right-skewed (i.e., normal expiratory flow direction)

## Class: `spiro_features_extraction`

Main container class encapsulating multiple feature extraction models.

---

### Subclass: `areaFE`

Calculates the area under the expiratory flow-volume loop and its predicted value using ECCS93 equations.

#### Initialization

```python
# FE_volume, FE_flow: arrays of volume (L) and flow (L/s)
# sex: 1 for male, 0 for female
# age: in years
# height: in cm
# race: string identifier for race-specific adjustments
area = spiro_features_extraction.areaFE(FE_volume, FE_flow, sex, age, height, race)
```

#### Methods

* `calc_AreaPred()`  
  Returns predicted AreaFE using demographic inputs via ECCS93.

* `calc_areaFE()`  
  Computes actual area under the FE curve using trapezoidal integration.

---

### Subclass: `angle_of_collapse`

Implements a data-driven geometric fitting model to compute the angle of collapse after PEF.

#### Initialization

```python
ac = spiro_features_extraction.angle_of_collapse(FE_volume, FE_flow)
```

#### Methods

* `generate_linemodel(x, y, index)`  
  Constructs a piecewise linear model intersecting point `(x, y)`.

* `min_line_model_error(plotProcess=False)`  
  Loops through all post-PEF points to find best-fitting point minimizing squared error. Set `plotProcess=True` to visualize the fitting process.

* `get_angle(x_p, y_p)`  
  Computes the geometric angle between two segments joined at `(x_p, y_p)`.

* `calc_AC(plotModel=False, plotProcess=False)`  
  Returns computed angle of collapse and squared error. Set `plotModel=True` to plot the fitted model; `plotProcess=True` to visualize fitting steps.

---

### Subclass: `deflating_baloon`

Models the FE signal using second-order ODE dynamics, simulating the lungs as a deflating balloon.

#### Initialization

```python
db = spiro_features_extraction.deflating_baloon(FE_time, FE_volume, FE_flow)
```

#### Core Methods

* `orient_and_snip_signal()`  
  Prepares volume/flow signals for modeling by standardizing orientation.

* `reorient_model()`  
  Reverts simulated signal to original coordinate system.

* `get_excitation_phase(T1, params)`  
  Handles the initial (excitation) phase of expiration based on model parameters.

* `calc_hypothesis(params)`  
  Simulates volume and flow using the current model parameters.

* `Cost_Function(params)`  
  Computes error between predicted and actual signals for optimization.

* `run_model(excitation_type, plot_model=False, add_title_text="", plot_FVL_only=False)`  
  Fits model using `differential_evolution`. The `excitation_type` argument controls which internal model branch to use: 
  - `"Linear"`, `"Exponential pressure"`, `"Non linear"`, or default (PEF-based).  
  Set `plot_model=True` to visualize the fitted model against data.

* `run_simulation(sim_param, num_sims, percentage_step, plot_FVL_only=True)`  
  Performs sensitivity analysis by varying one model parameter over multiple simulations.

* `calc_FEV1_FVC()`  
  Computes interpolated FEV1 and final FVC from simulated output.

* `plot_model(only_FVL, add_title_text)`  
  Plots comparison between actual and simulated flow/volume signals.

---

## Optimization Notes

All modeling is performed via `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution`.  
Fit metrics include:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
* RÂ² Score (flow and volume)

## Example Usage

```python
# Compute angle of collapse
ac = spiro_features_extraction.angle_of_collapse(volume, flow)
angle, cost = ac.calc_AC(plotModel=True)

# Compute AreaFE % predicted
af = spiro_features_extraction.areaFE(volume, flow, sex=1, age=35, height=170, race='Caucasian')
area_pred = af.calc_AreaPred()
area_actual = af.calc_areaFE()

# Fit balloon model
db = spiro_features_extraction.deflating_baloon(time, volume, flow)
db.run_model(excitation_type='Non linear', plot_model=True)
```
