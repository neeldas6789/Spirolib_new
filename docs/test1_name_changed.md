## Spirolib
A Python library for processing and analyzing spirometry data.

## Features
- Signal processing of spirometry data (`spiro_signal_process`)
- Feature extraction from spiro signals (`spiro_features_extraction`)
- Lightweight feature extraction (`spiro_features_lite`)
- Batch processing of spirometry data (`spiro_trialsbatch_process`, `spiro_batch_process`)
- Signal processing utilities (`utilities`)

## Installation
Clone the repository and use the library in your Python projects.

## Usage
```python
from spirolib import spiro_signal_process, spiro_features_extraction, spiro_features_lite, \
                           spiro_trialsbatch_process, spiro_batch_process, utilities
```
